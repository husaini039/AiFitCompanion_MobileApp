# Exercise Tracker with Pose Estimation

**Exercise Tracker** is a Flutter mobile app that uses Google ML Kit’s pose estimation system to live track the user's exercise. The app leverages the phone’s camera to track posture and movement, and if the posture is correct, it will count the exercise as a rep. The app also integrates Firebase for user data storage and authentication, with Google email sign-in.

## Features

- **Pose Estimation**: Uses Google ML Kit’s Pose Detection to track user posture and movement in real-time.
- **Exercise Rep Counting**: Counts exercise reps only when the correct posture is detected.
- **Profile Setup**: Users need to set up a profile and can customize their preferences.
- **Daily Tasks**: The app provides a randomized daily exercise task for users, with a goal to complete a certain number of reps.
- **Firebase Integration**: Stores user data (like progress and settings) securely in Firebase.
- **Google Email Authentication**: Secure and easy sign-in using Google Email.

## How to Use

1. **Set Up Profile**: Upon logging in with Google, users must set up their profile with basic details.
2. **Start Exercise**: The app uses the phone’s camera to track posture and movement in real-time.
3. **Exercise Reps**: Correct posture is tracked, and the app will count the number of reps based on the user’s form.
4. **Daily Task**: The app will randomize a task for the user each day to keep the exercises fresh and engaging.
5. **Track Progress**: View the exercise history, progress, and other details on the user profile.
